    "### Part 1\n",
    "You arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the password seems to have been changed, so you can't get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the dial were pointing at `11`, a rotation of `R8` would cause the dial to point at `19`. After that, a rotation of `L19` would cause it to point at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from `0` one click makes it point at `99`. Similarly, turning the dial right from `99` one click makes it point at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the dial were pointing at `5`, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at `95`. After that, a rotation of `R5` could cause it to point at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dial starts by pointing at `50`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at `0` after any rotation in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "L68\n",
    "L30\n",
    "R48\n",
    "L5\n",

    "L1\n",
    "L99\n",
    "R14\n",
    "L82\n",
    "```\n",
    "Following these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dial starts by pointing at `50`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L68` to point at `82`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L30` to point at `52`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `R48` to point at `0`.\n",

    "The dial is rotated `L55` to point at `0`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L1` to point at `99`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L99` to point at `0`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `R14` to point at `14`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L82` to point at `32`.\n",
    "Because the dial points at `0` a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is `3`.\n",
