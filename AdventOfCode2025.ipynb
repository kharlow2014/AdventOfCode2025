    "## Day 1: Secret Entrance\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "You arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the password seems to have been changed, so you can't get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the dial were pointing at `11`, a rotation of `R8` would cause the dial to point at `19`. After that, a rotation of `L19` would cause it to point at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from `0` one click makes it point at `99`. Similarly, turning the dial right from `99` one click makes it point at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the dial were pointing at `5`, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at `95`. After that, a rotation of `R5` could cause it to point at `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dial starts by pointing at `50`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at `0` after any rotation in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "L68\n",
    "L30\n",
    "R48\n",
    "L5\n",
    "R60\n",

    "L1\n",
    "L99\n",
    "R14\n",
    "L82\n",
    "```\n",
    "Following these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dial starts by pointing at `50`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L68` to point at `82`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L30` to point at `52`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `R48` to point at `0`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L5` to point at `95`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `R60` to point at `55`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L55` to point at `0`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L1` to point at `99`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L99` to point at `0`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `R14` to point at `14`.\n",
    "The dial is rotated `L82` to point at `32`.\n",
    "Because the dial points at `0` a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the rotations in your attached document. What's the actual password to open the door?"

    "\n",
    "You explain your need to get further underground. \"Well, you could at least take the escalator down to the printing department, not that you'd get much further than that without the elevators working. That is, you could if the escalator weren't also offline.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But, don't worry! It's not fried; it just needs power. Maybe you can get it running while I keep working on the elevators.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are batteries nearby that can supply emergency power to the escalator for just such an occasion. The batteries are each labeled with their joltage rating, a value from `1` to `9`. You make a note of their joltage ratings (your puzzle input). For example:\n",

Within each bank, you need to turn on exactly two batteries; the joltage that the bank produces is equal to the number formed by the digits on the batteries you've turned on. For example, if you have a bank like `12345` and you turn on batteries `2` and `4`, the bank would produce `24` jolts. (You cannot rearrange batteries.)\n",

    "In `818181911112111`, the largest joltage you can produce is `92`.\n",
