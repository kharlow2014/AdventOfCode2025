You aren't sure who is even allowed to visit the North Pole, but you know you can access the lobby through here, and from there you can access the rest of the North Pole base.\n",

    "\n",
    "They've even checked most of the product ID ranges already; they only have a few product ID ranges (your puzzle input) that you'll need to check. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "The ranges are separated by commas (,); each range gives its first ID and last ID separated by a dash (-).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the young Elf was just doing silly patterns, you can find the invalid IDs by looking for any ID which is made only of some sequence of digits repeated twice. So, `55` (5 twice), `6464` (64 twice), and `123123` (123 twice) would all be invalid IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the numbers have leading zeroes; `0101` isn't an ID at all. (`101` is a valid ID that you would ignore.)\n",
